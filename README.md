# ESP32-OTA-Blinker
Simple test for ESP32 firmware upgrade through OTAdrive

# What is OTAdrive

## Introduction

There are many companies that produce products based on hardwares such as ESP32/ESP8266, RaspberryPi, STM32 microcintrollers etc. Main problem to produce this products is firmware bugs! If there were any bug about formware, company doesn't access to customer to update product's firmware. By the way upgrading firmwares usually need technical knowlegde and programmer where customer doesn't have any of these.

[OTA drive](http://www.otadrive.com) is here to help solve this problem. Today we support ESP32/ESP8266 and you can upgrade your ESP32/ESP8266 based product without any server developing.
